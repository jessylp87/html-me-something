            <h2>Coco Beach, FL</h2>
            <p>
                I frequently visit Florida multiple times a year to visit my brother and sister-in-law. As much as I absolutely HATE humidity, this is one of my favorite places to visit. Maybe it's due to the fact that I have always been so close with my family and am always happy to spend time with them. I've also discovered in the last year that I one of my "happy places" is sitting on the beach, reading a book, having a cold one, and taking in that ocean breeze. It's something that I frequently crave to do because it's just so calming. I'm an adventure photographer so I always have my camera on me, ready to photograph any inspiration that I find. For whatever reason, Florida is on the top of my list of favorite places to be and photograph.

                <h2>Colorado Springs, CO</h2>
                <p>
                    Colorado has always held a special place in my heart. It's the one place on this earth where I feel completely at home. I've been to Colorado a handful of times and absolutely love it and am amazed by it's beauty every single time. Colorado Springs is probably my favorite part of Colorado, but I do plan on having a roadtrip to travel throughout the entire state. I want to see everything in it. Whenever I travel to The Springs, I love to visit the Garden of the Gods and Pike's Peak. Not only is this place absolutely gorgeous, but the people are awesome, and the food is fantastic!

            <h2>Seattle, WA</h2>
            <p>
                Visting Seattle was such an odd experience, but also breathtaking. I had very mixed emotions about my visit last year. In one hand I found a lot of the people very unfriendly at first and in the other once I got to know some of the locals, I understood what the unkindness was all about. Washington is such a gorgeous state with an impecable eco system. The land was breathtakingly beautiful. My fiance and I drove halfway around the Olympia National Park loop and we were just in awe. It was a lot to take it and marvelous. We found out pretty quickly that a lot of the smaller town locals aren't fans of "tourists" because they tend to trash nature and kill it. Once we got to talking to people, they were much more friendly when they realized we weren't there for the wrong reasons. We hiked and left the beauty of mother nature completely unscathed.

                <h2>Kauai, HI</h2>
                <p>
                    I recently visited Kauai on a photography retreat. It was a once in a lifetime experience that I was completely blessed with having that opportunity. Kauai held shock factor at every turn. It was incredibly beautiful and left us all speechless. We got to go on a helicoptor tour and snorkel with sea turtles. We hiked to hidden beaches and watched every sunrise and sunset. The locals were incredibly friendly and helpful. I plan on going again next year, but we'll see!
